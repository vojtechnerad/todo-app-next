# Todo app

This project was created as part of the extracurricular course `4IT427 React.js Programming Basics` at university.

It's a simple Todo application built with Next.js and React, designed to help me practice in `React` framework, as well as to understand concepts of server side rendering using `Next.js`.

I also wanted to try the `shadcn/ui` library and their approach to generating components, as opposed to using predefined component libraries, which I'm more used to working with.

The application stores data in a local `SQLite` database, managed through the `Prisma` ORM. Prisma provides a type-safe and developer-friendly way to interact with the database, making it easier to handle queries and maintain data consistency throughout the app.

## Used technologies

- `Next.js` (App Router)
- `React`
- `Tailwind CSS` – for styling
- `shadcn/ui` – for UI components
- `Prisma` – for ORM
- `SQLite` – as the database
- `Prettier` – for code formatting
